Welcome to my internship progress repository for the Edunet AI/ML Internship, which I secured through the AICTE Internship Portal. This repository documents my weekly progress during the 4-week internship under the AI/ML domain, and it includes all relevant code, notebooks, reports, and updates.

📌 Internship Details

Domain: Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning

Duration: 4 Weeks

Project Title: Garbage Classification using Transfer Learning

Organization: Edunet Foundation

🧠 Project Overview

📂 Project: Garbage Classification through Transfer Learning

In this project, we aim to develop a garbage classification system that automates waste segregation using EfficientNetV2B2 and transfer learning techniques. Efficient waste sorting is a key step in optimizing recycling processes and enhancing environmental sustainability.

🎯 Project Goal

To develop an accurate and efficient garbage classification model using EfficientNetV2B2 and transfer learning for automated waste sorting.

By utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, this project targets better accuracy in classifying different types of waste such as cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and more.
